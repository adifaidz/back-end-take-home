Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, API End points. This test is very open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

Managing product inventory requires adding products to a product catalog and adding warehouses to store the products.

Develop a backend app that exposes endpoints API for managing inventory at a Regov Warehouse.

1. Add product
2. Add warehouse
3. Stock
4. Unstock
5. List product
6. List warehouses
7. List warehouse
8. Delete product

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can register on the Api.

  - List products
  - Add warehouse
  - List warehouse

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!
